# B-List BeatList: Another Beat Saber Playlist Maker
Inspired by Beatlist, this is a simple Beat Saber playlist maker coded in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for Desktop. Unlike newer versions of Beatlist this app hashes and recognizes songs locally and as such can recognize beatmaps not uploaded to Beatsaver. This is particularily useful (and really only useful) for creating playlists with songs generated by Beat Sage.

# Issues
- Might feel like it freezes (it isn't frozen I promise!...hopefully) as it loads installed songs and playlists.
- Can't delete Playlists or search for songs
- Cumbersome to use because UI design is my passion.
- No File Chooser (have to type in the path to Beat Saber.exe)
- No images
- Probably a lurking null related error
- Probably conflicts with Beat Saver
- Unless you have no intention of uploading Beat Sage songs to Beat Saver, use Beatlist, it's great!
